# Web-Design-Challenge

### From Data Analytics Bootcamp at Tecnologico de Monterrey Campus Monterrey

* For this homework a visualization dashboard website using visualizations is being created. Specifically, the distribution of elements in stellar populations in our Galaxy, the Milky Way, are shown. 

* The data is from the APOGEE survey and the databases were already cleaned and separated by galaxy components using the TopCat application. In /Resources the databases are posted with a Jupyter Notebook of how the plots were obtained.

* In building this dashboard, individual pages for each plot are created and a means by which it can be navigated between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. It also has a landing page, a page where all of the plots are compared, and another page where the data used to build them is shown.
